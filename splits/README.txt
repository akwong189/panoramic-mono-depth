1. These files are for reference only. 
2. The four columns of data are directories of image, depth, depth mask and surface normal, respectively. 
3. In order to keep high accuracy of our dataset, for some scans, we only provide depth and keep normal data unavailable (marked as "Unavailable" in .csv files). 
4. In our setting, the compressed normal data file are renamed as "train_normal" or "val_normal" after download.
